Our connector plugins trigger a push-a-button connection and thus eliminate the inconvenience of sharing logins, passwords, and all kinds of keys. 

Magento Plugin Installation

1. Go to the Magento admin panel and navigate System -> Magento connect -> Magento connect manager.
2. Login with the same credentials you use to access your admin panel.
3. Then under Direct package file upload you can Upload package file. Click the Choose File button, select the extension .tgz file, and click Upload.
To ensure the plugin is installed correctly, use the PHP version that matches the Magento version requirements. 

If the version of PHP conflicts with the version of Magento in use, we suggest that you should install it using the following instructions:

1. Unzip the archive and upload the files to the server. 
2. Clear the Magento cache by going into System-> Cache Management, selecting all in the list, choosing the Refresh option in the dropdown menu, and finally clicking Submit.
3. Go to System-> Configuration and find API2CART Bridge in the menu on the left. 


Service enhancement takes research, data collection, and analysis. That is why we added a snipped of tracking code into our plugins. It gets activated after the connector has been installed. It does not track any personal data and serves as a statistics means only.
